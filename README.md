# CryptoClustering
 
We were approached by a prominent investment bank seeking our expertise in generating a comprehensive report on the vast array of cryptocurrencies available in the trading market. The goal was to develop a classification system for these cryptocurrencies to facilitate the creation of a new investment portfolio. To accomplish this, we employed advanced techniques such as dimension reduction using PCA and clustering using K-Means. By reducing the dimensions and clustering the data, we were able to gain insights into the characteristics of different cryptocurrencies and identify distinct groups within the market. This analysis will enable the investment bank to make informed decisions and provide their customers with a well-structured and diversified investment offering in the exciting world of cryptocurrencies.
